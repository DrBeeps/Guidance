(THIS IS NOT A STABLE RELEASE, STILL IN DEVELOPMENT, PLEASE BE AWARE OF UPCOMING CHANGES)

Guidance is an experimental set of tools for physics simulations involving guidance, navigation, and control of rockets and rocket-related bodies. The main objective for this
program is to be modular and intuitive enough for anyone to modify and simulate their own systems in.

Guidance also features a data logging and data parsing module for processing and creating flight data files for analysis and visualization within Guidance or external programs.

As of now, Guidance requires Matplotlib for data visualization.

I don't assume any responsibility for anything flown or tested using this program, use and modify at your own risk.
